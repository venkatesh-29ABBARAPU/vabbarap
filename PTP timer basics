HOW PTP used n ethernet for tx/rx packets: 

A PTP (Precision Time Protocol) timer is used in Ethernet to provide nanosecond-accurate timestamps for network packets by performing the timing operations entirely in the hardware of the 
Network Interface Card {NIC} or Ethernet {MAC}$. This eliminates the variable delays and jitter introduced by the software network stack and the kernel.
⏰ PTP Timestamping MechanismThe process uses the {PTP}$ Hardware Clock {PHC}$), which is a high-resolution, free-running counter built into the Ethernet controller.
1. Transmit  Timestamping
When a PTP synchronization message (like Sync}$ or Delay Request}$) is sent:
Software Action: The PTP daemon in the operating system sends the 
packet down the network stack.
Hardware Action (Crucial Step): The moment the packet's first byte physically leaves the {MAC} and is transmitted onto the wire, the {PTP} hardware timer logic 
instantaneously latches the current value of the {PHC}$ counter.
Reporting: This captured hardware time is stored in a special register or a $\text{FIFO}$ queue within the {NIC}$. 
The hardware then generates an interrupt, and the Ethernet driver retrieves this precise hardware timestamp.
Delivery: The driver passes this time back up to the $\text{PTP}$ software daemon, which uses it to calculate the precise clock offset.

2. Receive {Rx}Timestamping
When a PTP synchronization message arrives:
Hardware Action (Crucial Step): The moment the packet's first byte arrives from the physical layer {PHY} and enters the {MAC}layer, the $PTP}$ hardware instantaneously latches the current value of the 
{PHC}$ counter.
In-Band Attachment: The $\text{PTP}$ hardware often replaces a placeholder field in the packet buffer with this hardware timestamp before the packet is passed up to the {DMA}$ engine and into the kernel buffers.
Reporting: The software {PTP} daemon reads the timestamp directly from the packet data or the associated metadata provided by the driver.

By stamping the packet at the point of transmission or reception, the $\text{PTP}$ timer ensures that the timestamp reflects the moment the electrical signal leaves or arrives, 
eliminating all non-deterministic delays in the host system. This is what allows $\text{PTP}$ to achieve $\text{nanosecond}$ $\text{accuracy}$ across a network.
